# tps-torch
A PyTorch-based package for string methods and ML-inspired path sampling methods

At the moment, building and installation is just:

```console

mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../
make -j6
pip install .

```
The same thing can be done inside the muller-brown folder to build the Muller-Brown potential example
