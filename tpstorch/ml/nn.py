class CommittorLoss(_Loss):
    r"""Creates a loss function for the commitor based on the Backward Kolmogorov Equation
    It takes gradients as input. All we need to do is to take the dot product to get the loss.
    However, to get some normal Loss function behavior right, I inherit _Loss
    each element in the input :math:`x` and target :math:`y`.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = \left( x_n - y_n \right)^2,

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) =
        \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    :math:`x` and :math:`y` are tensors of arbitrary shapes with a total
    of :math:`n` elements each.

    The mean operation still operates over all the elements, and divides by :math:`n`.

    The division by :math:`n` can be avoided if one sets ``reduction = 'sum'``.

    Args:
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where :math:`*` means, any number of additional
          dimensions
        - Target: :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input

    Examples::

        >>> loss = nn.MSELoss()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.randn(3, 5)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()
